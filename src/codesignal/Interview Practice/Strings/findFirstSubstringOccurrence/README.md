# findFirstSubstringOccurrence

_Avoid using built-in functions to solve this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview._

Implement a function that takes two strings, `s` and `x`, as arguments and finds the first occurrence of the string `x` in `s`. The function should return an integer indicating the index in `s` of the first occurrence of `x`. If there are no occurrences of `x` in `s`, return `-1`.
