# How many are smaller than me II?

This is a hard version of How many are smaller than me?. If you have troubles solving this one, have a look at the easier kata first.

Write

```
function smaller(arr)
```

that given an array `arr`, you have to return the amount of numbers that are smaller than `arr[i]` to the right.

For example:

```
smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
smaller([1, 2, 0]) === [1, 1, 0]
```
