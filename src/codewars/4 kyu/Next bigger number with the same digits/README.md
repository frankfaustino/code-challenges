# Next bigger number with the same digits

You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

```js
12 ==> 21
513 ==> 531
2017 ==> 2071
```

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return `-1`:

```js
9 ==> -1
111 ==> -1
531 ==> -1
```
