# Playing with digits

Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

* 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1
* 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2
* 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given two positive integers `n` and `p`, we want to find a positive integer `k`, if it exists, such that the sum of the digits of `n` raised to consecutive powers starting from `p` is equal to `k * n`. 

In other words, writing the consecutive digits of `n` as `a, b, c, d ...`, is there an integer `k` such that :
```math
(a^p + b^{p + 1} + c^{p + 2} + d^{p + 3} + ...) = n * k
```

If it is the case we will return `k`, if not return `-1`.

**Note**: `n` and `p` will always be strictly positive integers.

## Examples:

```
n = 89; p = 1 ---> 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1

n = 92; p = 1 ---> -1 since there is no k such that 9¹ + 2² equals 92 * k

n = 695; p = 2 ---> 2 since 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

n = 46288; p = 3 ---> 51 since 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51
```
