# Simple Simple Simple String Expansion

Given a string that includes alphanumeric characters ("3a4B2d") return the expansion of that string: The numeric values represent the occurrence of each letter preceding that numeric value. There should be no numeric characters in the final string.

#### Notes
* The first occurrence of a numeric value should be the number of times each character behind it is repeated, until the next numeric value appears
* If there are multiple consecutive numeric characters, only the last one should be used (ignore the previous ones)
* Empty strings should return an empty string. 

Your code should be able to work for both lower and capital case letters.

```python
"3D2a5d2f"  -->  "DDDaadddddff"    # basic example: 3 * "D" + 2 * "a" + 5 * "d" + 2 * "f"
"3abc"      -->  "aaabbbccc"       # not "aaabc", nor "abcabcabc"; 3 * "a" + 3 * "b" + 3 * "c"
"3d332f2a"  -->  "dddffaa"         # multiple consecutive digits: 3 * "d" + 2 * "f" + 2 * "a"
"abcde"     -->  "abcde"           # no digits
"1111"      -->  ""                # no characters to repeat
""          -->  ""                # empty string
```
