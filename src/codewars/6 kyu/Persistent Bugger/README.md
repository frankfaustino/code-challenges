# Persistent Bugger

Write a function, `persistence`, that takes in a positive parameter `num` and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in `num` until you reach a single digit.

For example:

```
persistence(39) => 3  # Because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      # and 4 has only one digit.

persistence(999) => 4 # Because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                      # 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2.

persistence(4) => 0   # Because 4 is already a one-digit number.
```

```
persistence(39) # returns 3, because 3*9=27, 2*7=14, 1*4=4
                # and 4 has only one digit

persistence(999) # returns 4, because 9*9*9=729, 7*2*9=126,
                # 1*2*6=12, and finally 1*2=2

persistence(4) # returns 0, because 4 is already a one-digit number
