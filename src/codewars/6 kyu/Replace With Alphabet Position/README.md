# Replace With Alphabet Position

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

`"a" = 1`, `"b" = 2`, etc.

## Example <!-- unlisted languages will use the first entry. please keep python up top. -->

```python
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
```

Should return `"20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"` ( as a string )
