# Transform To Prime

#### Task :

Given a List [] of n integers , find minimum number to be inserted in a list, so that sum of all elements of list should equal the closest prime number .

#### Notes

- List size is at least 2 .0
- List's numbers will only positives (n > 0) .
- Repetition of numbers in the list could occur .
- The newer list's sum should equal the closest prime number .

#### Input >> Output Examples

```
1- minimumNumber ({3,1,2}) ==> return (1)
```

#### Explanation:

Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (6) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (1) , which will make the sum of the List equal the closest prime number (7) .

```
2-  minimumNumber ({2,12,8,4,6}) ==> return (5)
```

#### Explanation:

Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (32) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (5) , which will make the sum of the List equal the closest prime number (37) .

```
3- minimumNumber ({50,39,49,6,17,28}) ==> return (2)
```

#### Explanation:

Since , the sum of the list's elements equal to (189) , the minimum number to be inserted to transform the sum to prime number is (2) , which will make the sum of the List equal the closest prime number (191) .
