# Sum The Tree

Given a node object representing a binary tree:
```
Node:
  value: <int>,
  left: <Node> or null,
  right: <Node> or null
```

Write a function that returns the sum of all values, including the root. Absence of a node will be indicated with a `null` value.

Examples:
```
10
| \
1  2
=> 13

1
| \
0  0
    \
     2
=> 3
```
