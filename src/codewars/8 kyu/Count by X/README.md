# Count by X

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first
`n` multiples of `x`.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive
numbers greater than `0`.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples

```rust
count_by(1, 10) // should return vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count_by(2,5) // should return vec![2,4,6,8,10]
```
