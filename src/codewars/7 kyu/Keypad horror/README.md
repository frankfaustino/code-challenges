# Keypad horror

Having two standards for a keypad layout is inconvenient!  
Computer keypad's layout:  
![7 8 9 \n 4 5 6 \n 1 2 3 \n 0 \n](Numpad.svg)

Cell phone keypad's layout:  
![1 2 3\n 4 5 6\n 7 8 9\n 0\n](Mobile_phone_keyboard.svg)

Solve the horror of un-standardized keypads by providing a function that converts computer input to a number as if it was typed on a phone.

Example:  
"789" -> "123"  

Notes:  
You get a string with numbers only
