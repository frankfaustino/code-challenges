# What is the flag?

- The flag is hidden in the string variable `FLAG`
- The flag is in the format `FLAG{CAPITAL-LETTERS-WITH-HYPHEN}`
- The flag couldn't be found from the string literal right away... but You can indeed see it somehow!
- A magic number `16` might help... but how should it be used?
