# Numbers with this digit inside

You have to search all numbers from inclusive 1 to inclusive a given number `x`, that have the given digit `d` in it.  
The value of `d` will always be 0 - 9.  
The value of `x` will always be greater than 0.

You have to return as an array
- the count of these numbers,
- their sum
- and their product.

For example:
```
x = 11
d = 1
->
Numbers: 1, 10, 11
Return: [3, 22, 110]
```

If there are no numbers, which include the digit, return `[0,0,0]`.
