[Playing With Lists/Arrays Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-lists-slash-arrays)

#### Task

Given an array of integers, Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product.

#### Notes

- Array/list will contain positives only
- Array/list will always have even size

#### Input >> Output Examples

```
minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22) 
```

#### Explanation:

- The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product,  `5*2 + 3*4 = 22`

```
minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) ==> return (342)
```

#### Explanation:

- The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product,  `26*3 + 24*6 + 12*10 = 342`

```
minSum({9,2,8,7,5,4,0,6}) ==> return (74)
```

#### Explanation:

The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product,  `9*0 + 8*2 +7*4 +6*5 = 74`
