# Remove the minimum

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.


#### Examples

```
* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
```
