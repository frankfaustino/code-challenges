 * Given a sum and a product, find two integers x and y, where x + y === sum, and x * y === product.
 * You will return this in an array.
 * For example, calling sumAndProduct(6, 9) should return [3, 3] because 3 + 3 === 6, and 3 * 3 === 9.
 * Please make sure to return your array such that x <= y in the format [x, y].
