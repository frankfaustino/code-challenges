/* ———
 * A twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by two.
 * Write a function called isTwinPrime which takes an integer and returns true if it is a twin prime, or false if it is not.
 *
 * Example:
 * 5 is a prime, and 5 + 2 = 7, which is also a prime, so returns true.
 * 9 is not a prime, and so does not need checking, so it returns false.
 * 7 is a prime, but 7 + 2 = 9, which is not a prime. However, 7 - 2 = 5, which is a prime, so it returns true.
 * 23 is a prime, but 23 + 2 is 25, which is not a prime. 23 - 2 is 21, which isn't a prime either, so 23 is not a twin prime.
