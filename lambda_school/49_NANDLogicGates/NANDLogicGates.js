/* ———
 * For this coding challenge you will be recreating low level logic gates.
 * You will first create the NAND function and then you will create
 * NOT, OR, AND, and XOR all using the NAND function that you created.
 * Implement NAND however you would like and then use NAND to implement the
 * other logic gates.
 * See the link below for the truth tables for these logic gates.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_logic#NAND
 * All functions should return a 1 for true and a 0 for false.

  // You can use any logical operator: && || !
}

function NOT(n) {
  // Do not use: !
}

function AND(x, y) {
  // Do not use: && || !
  // You can use any of the functions that you have already written.
}

  // Do not use: || && !
  // You can use any of the functions that you have already written.
